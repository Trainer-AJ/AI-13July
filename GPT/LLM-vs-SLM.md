## 📚 Definitions

### 🧠 **LLM = Large Language Model**

* A **language model** trained on a massive amount of data
* Has **billions (or even trillions) of parameters**
* Can perform a wide range of tasks: writing, summarizing, translating, coding, reasoning, etc.

#### 🔍 Examples:

* GPT-4 (OpenAI)
* Claude (Anthropic)
* Gemini (Google)
* LLaMA (Meta)
* Falcon, Mistral, etc.

#### 🧠 Typical Size:

* 7B, 13B, 70B, up to 1T+ parameters

---

### 🧠 **SLM = Small Language Model**

* A **smaller version** of a language model
* Optimized to run faster, use less memory, and work on edge devices or small servers
* Trained on smaller datasets or distilled from LLMs
* May sacrifice some reasoning or generality for speed and cost

#### 🔍 Examples:

* DistilBERT (smaller version of BERT)
* TinyLLaMA
* MiniGPT
* Phi-2 (Microsoft)
* Mistral-7B (compact but high-performing)

#### 🧠 Typical Size:

* 125M to 3B parameters (some go up to 7B and still call themselves "small" due to efficiency)
