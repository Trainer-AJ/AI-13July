The statement is saying synchronous operations are slower because of how they handle tasks, especially in network-heavy or I/O-bound scenarios like communicating with an AI API. Let's break this down:


---

🔁 Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Operations

✅ Synchronous Client (slower in high-performance scenarios):

Executes one operation at a time.

Your code waits (blocks) for the response before moving to the next instruction.

Example:

response = client.get_prediction(data)
# waits here until response is returned

Problem: If you're making lots of requests (e.g. hundreds or thousands), each one must wait for the previous one to complete, which creates a bottleneck.


⚡ Asynchronous Client (faster for many tasks):

Executes multiple operations concurrently using asyncio.

Your code does not block — it can start a request and move on to others while waiting for the first to complete.

Example:

response = await client.get_prediction(data)

Used with:

import asyncio
asyncio.run(my_async_function())

Benefit: When making many calls (e.g., to an AI service), you can issue many requests at once and handle them as responses come in — much more efficient.

🚀 Why It Matters for an AI Client

If you're building an AI client that interacts with a service like AIProjectClient, you're likely:

Sending/receiving data over the network

Waiting for responses (e.g., completions, predictions, classifications)


In such cases:

Synchronous client: Each request blocks the next — slower throughput

Asynchronous client: Can fire off many requests without blocking — better performance



---

🧠 TL;DR

> Synchronous operations are slower in high-performance scenarios because they block the program while waiting for each AI API response. An asynchronous client can handle many requests concurrently, which is faster and more efficient, especially under heavy workloads.



Let me know if you'd like a code comparison between the two!
Great question — and you're not alone in wondering this! While asynchronous (async) programming is more efficient in many scenarios, especially high-concurrency or network-heavy ones like AI clients, it's not always the best default. Here’s why both sync and async exist, and why sync is still widely supported:


---

🧭 1. Simplicity and Ease of Use

Synchronous code is easier to understand and write.

It follows a simple top-down flow.

No need to understand event loops, await, or async def.



Example (sync):

response = client.get_prediction(data)
print(response)

Example (async):

async def main():
    response = await client.get_prediction(data)
    print(response)

asyncio.run(main())

To a beginner (or in simple scripts), sync is cleaner and easier.


---

🪛 2. Compatibility

Many environments (like scripts, some frameworks, notebooks, or legacy systems) don’t support async easily.

You can’t always use await at the top level without managing an event loop.

Async code doesn’t always play well with libraries that expect sync (e.g. certain logging, file I/O, database drivers, or web frameworks).



---

⚙️ 3. Not Always Faster

Async is beneficial mostly for I/O-bound tasks (e.g. API calls, file reads).

If your app is CPU-bound or only makes a few calls, async adds complexity without much gain.

For small workloads, sync can be faster due to less overhead.



---

🧪 4. Debugging and Tooling

Sync code is easier to debug.

Stack traces are simpler.

Breakpoints and logs work more predictably.


Async code can be tricky — errors sometimes get swallowed if not awaited correctly.



---

🔄 Why Not Make Async the Default?

Because:

Many users don’t need it.

It adds complexity for small tasks or beginners.

Making async the default would force everyone to manage event loops even for simple use cases.



---

✅ The Best Practice

Default to sync for:

Simplicity

Scripts with few API calls

Quick experiments (e.g., in Jupyter)


Use async when:

You need to send many concurrent API calls

You’re integrating into an async environment (e.g., FastAPI, async web apps)

You want maximum efficiency




---

🧠 TL;DR

> Async is powerful but more complex. Sync is simpler and good enough for many use cases. That’s why both exist — so you can choose what fits your situation best.
