Yes, you're absolutely right! In **regression**, especially **linear regression**, we:

1. **Plot training data** (input vs. output).
2. **Fit a straight line** (like \( y = mx + c \)) that best represents the relationship.
3. Use this line to **predict future values** based on new inputs.

- **Blue dots**: Training data points.
- **Red line**: The learned regression line.
- **Equation**: The model learns the best-fit line \( y = mx + c \) using the training data.

> This line helps the model generalize and make predictions for unseen data by estimating the output based on the input.

- Loss is a numerical metric that describes how wrong a model's predictions are.

You're definitely on the right track conceptually, but the **statement needs a few corrections and clarifications**. Let's go through it step-by-step and clean it up:

---

### üî¢ Given:

* Your prediction = 3
* Actual value = 5
* Error (residual) = **prediction ‚àí actual = 3 ‚àí 5 = -2**

So far, so good!

---

### ‚ùå Statement:

> **"loss = -2"**

This part is **not quite accurate**.

**Loss ‚â† just the error.**
Instead, **loss is a function** of the error ‚Äî for example:

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** uses:
  $\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum (\text{prediction} - \text{actual})^2$

* So here:
  $\text{MSE} = (-2)^2 = 4$

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** uses:
  $\text{MAE} = |\text{prediction} - \text{actual}| = | -2 | = 2$

So:

‚úÖ The **error is -2**
‚úÖ But the **loss is 4 (MSE)** or **2 (MAE)**

---

### ‚úîÔ∏è Corrected Statement:

> Prediction = 3
> Actual value = 5
> Error = -2
> **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** = 4
> **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** = 2
>
> Squaring or taking the absolute value **removes the sign**, ensuring the loss is always positive.
>
> * **MSE penalizes larger errors more (sensitive to outliers)**
> * **MAE treats all errors equally (more robust to outliers)**
>
> You choose the one based on how you want to handle **outliers** and **error sensitivity**.

### üîÅ Summary:

| Metric | Formula                  | Sensitive to Outliers? | Example (Error = -2) |                  |   |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | - |
| MSE    | $\frac{1}{n} \sum (e^2)$ | ‚úÖ Yes (squares error)  | 4                    |                  |   |
| MAE    | ( \frac{1}{n} \sum       | e                      | )                    | ‚ùå Less sensitive | 2 |

Let me know if you‚Äôd like a visual or graph of how MSE vs. MAE reacts to different errors.


**Outliers come from real data ‚Äî not from the model's predictions.**

## Gradient descent 
- keep guessing the bias (intercept at y axis) and weight (slope) till the loss line converges (meaning it no more descreases) it continues with almost same value - [docs](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/gradient-descent)
