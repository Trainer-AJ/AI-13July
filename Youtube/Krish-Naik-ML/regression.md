Yes, you're absolutely right! In **regression**, especially **linear regression**, we:

1. **Plot training data** (input vs. output).
2. **Fit a straight line** (like \( y = mx + c \)) that best represents the relationship.
3. Use this line to **predict future values** based on new inputs.

- **Blue dots**: Training data points.
- **Red line**: The learned regression line.
- **Equation**: The model learns the best-fit line \( y = mx + c \) using the training data.

> This line helps the model generalize and make predictions for unseen data by estimating the output based on the input.

### check model efficiency 
> via Loss or cost function
- Loss is a numerical metric that describes how wrong a model's predictions are.
