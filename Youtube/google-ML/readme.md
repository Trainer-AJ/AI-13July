> Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables a system to autonomously learn and improve using neural networks and deep learning, without being explicitly programmed, by feeding it large amounts of data.
> Machine learning allows computer systems to continuously adjust and enhance themselves as they accrue more “experiences.” Thus, the performance of these systems can be improved by providing larger and more varied datasets to be processed.
