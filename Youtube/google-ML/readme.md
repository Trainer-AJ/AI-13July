> Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables a system to autonomously learn and improve using neural networks and deep learning, without being explicitly programmed, by feeding it large amounts of data.
> Machine learning allows computer systems to continuously adjust and enhance themselves as they accrue more “experiences.” Thus, the performance of these systems can be improved by providing larger and more varied datasets to be processed.

[Google docs - what is ML](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-machine-learning)

ML is about learning patterns from data to:

✅ Predict future data (supervised learning)

✅ Discover hidden structure (unsupervised learning)

✅ Make decisions (reinforcement learning)

learning then creating new stuff inspired by training data (Gen AI) 

- generative models are initially trained using an unsupervised approach, where the model learns to mimic the data it's trained on

Model is a mathematical relationship derived from data that an ML system uses to make predictions
