## Calculas
- Calculus Math is generally used in Mathematical models to obtain optimal solutions. It helps us to understand the changes between the values which are related by a function
- To get the optimal solution, derivatives are used to find the maxima and minima values of a function.
> The derivative is the measure of the rate of change (the tangent or slope) of a function whereas integral is the measure of the area under the curve.
- **Partial derivative**: It tells you: How the function changes with respect to one variable, while keeping all other variables constant.
### 🧠 Intuition:
Imagine a **hilly landscape** (a 3D surface) where:
- \( x \) is east-west,
- \( y \) is north-south,
- and the height \( z = f(x, y) \) is the elevation.

A **partial derivative** answers:
- “If I walk only east-west (change \( x \)), how steep is the hill?”
- That’s \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \)

---

### 📌 Example:
Let’s say:

$$
f(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2
$$

Then:
- \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x + 3y \)
- \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 3x + 2y \)

Each tells you how the function changes **in one direction**, holding the other variable fixed.
